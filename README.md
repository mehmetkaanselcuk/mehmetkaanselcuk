### ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mehmet Kaan SelÃ§uk

I'm a 2nd-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student. I'm interested in programming, electronics, and building small useful projects. I mainly use Java and sometimes C or MATLAB for my work.

Most of the projects on this profile are simple console-based tools or games that I made to improve my skills and have fun while learning.
